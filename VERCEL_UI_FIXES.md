# Vercel Deployment Fixes - Viewport Warning and UI Loading Issues

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Viewport Metadata Warning
**Problem**: `⚠ Unsupported metadata viewport is configured in metadata export in /test-amnis. Please move it to viewport export instead.`

**Solution**: Updated `src/app/layout.tsx` to use the new Next.js 15 viewport API:
- Moved viewport configuration from `metadata` to separate `viewport` export
- Updated TypeScript imports to include `Viewport` type
- Used proper viewport object format instead of string

### 2. Connect Wallet Button Not Loading
**Problem**: Connect wallet button not appearing on Vercel deployment

**Solution**: Enhanced `src/lib/WalletProvider.tsx` with better SSR handling:
- Added client-side detection with `useState` and `useEffect`
- Prevented wallet provider from rendering until client-side hydration
- Added better error handling and logging
- Improved error messages for debugging

### 3. Logo Not Loading
**Problem**: Application logo not displaying on Vercel

**Solution**: Updated `src/components/ui/logo.tsx` with robust error handling:
- Added client-side detection to prevent SSR issues
- Implemented fallback UI for server-side rendering
- Added error handling for failed image loads
- Added proper image optimization settings
- Included fallback text "Y" when image fails to load

### 4. Enhanced Next.js Configuration
**Updated**: `next.config.js` with better image optimization:
- Added modern image formats (WebP, AVIF)
- Set minimum cache TTL for better performance
- Added SVG support with proper CSP
- Enhanced chunk splitting for better loading

## Key Changes Made

### Files Modified:
1. `src/app/layout.tsx` - Fixed viewport metadata warning
2. `src/lib/WalletProvider.tsx` - Enhanced SSR handling for wallet
3. `src/components/ui/logo.tsx` - Added robust error handling and fallbacks
4. `next.config.js` - Enhanced image optimization

### Technical Improvements:
- **SSR Compatibility**: All components now properly handle server-side rendering
- **Error Boundaries**: Added fallback UI for failed image loads
- **Client-Side Detection**: Prevented hydration mismatches
- **Image Optimization**: Better caching and format support
- **Error Handling**: Improved debugging and user feedback

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Local Testing**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

2. **Check Browser Console**: Look for any remaining hydration warnings

3. **Test Features**:
   - Logo displays correctly
   - Connect wallet button appears
   - Wallet connection works
   - No viewport warnings in console

4. **Vercel Deployment**: 
   - Monitor build logs for errors
   - Check browser console on production
   - Test wallet functionality

## Expected Results

After deployment:
- ✅ No viewport metadata warnings
- ✅ Connect wallet button loads properly
- ✅ Logo displays with fallback if needed
- ✅ Better error handling and user feedback
- ✅ Improved performance with optimized images

## Monitoring

Watch for:
- Console errors related to hydration
- Wallet connection issues
- Image loading failures
- Any remaining SSR/CSR mismatches
